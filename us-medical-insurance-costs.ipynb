    "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of males and females?\n",
    "- Are certain variables likely to affect insurance costs more?\n",
    "- What is the average insurance cost for a US citizen?\n",

    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of males and females?\n",
    "    - The number of males is slightly higher than females 676 vs 662\n",
    "- Are certain variables likely to affect insurance costs more?\n",
    "    - Yes, while all variables proved to affect the insurance cost Smoking had the biggest difference with the non-smoker average being only 26% of the average cost for smokers. \n",
    "- What is the average insurance cost for a US citizen?\n",
    "    - The average insurance cost is 13270$\n",
    "- Does the age affect the insurance cost?\n",
    "    - Yes, on average older people tend to have a greater insurance cost than younger people."
